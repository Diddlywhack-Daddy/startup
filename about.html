        <h2>Website Creator</h2>
        <p>This website was created by Jacob Larson as a web programming project.</p>

        <h2>Project Background</h2>
        <p> College Students have to deal with different professors using different classroom management systems with different grading scales. This website was designed to enable the student to put all of their homework information in one place and enable smart time management.
          </p>
      <h2>Use of AI</h2>
      <p>As the project was larger and more difficult than initially intended, ChatGPT was used to create a framework for some elements of the UI.</p>

        <h2>Privacy Promise</h2>
        <p>We promise to never sell your personal information.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>While steps were taken to make your data secure, this website was made by an amateur as a learning experience, and we cannot guarantee your data security.</p>
