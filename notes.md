This is my notes file:

GITHUB COMMANDS:
Git add must be used on an existing file.
git commit -am "commit message"
git push then pushes changes to your repo
git pull pulls latest changes from your repo
git fetch and status enable you to check for dif without changing your clone

You can also fork a repo and basically clone it to your github, then make changes and resubmit it.
